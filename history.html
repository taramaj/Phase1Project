        <div class="histext"><p>Community gardens have a long history in the United States.  They date back to the 1890's in Detroit during the economic recession.  In New York City, the first community gardens appeared during the 1970's in abandoned lots during the time when the city was bankrupt.  By definition, a community garden is any piece of land which is shared and cared for by a group of people.  In NYC, they allow city dwellers to grow their own organic food, get closer to nature, and build relationships within their communities.  Gardens lead composting and recycling efforts, beautify vacant lots, and help to revitalize their neighborhoods.  Gardens provide a peaceful oasis to retreat from the urban bustle.  Community gardens are a reflection of those who care for them....</p>
